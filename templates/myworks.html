   Land is essential component of nature for performing any type of economic activity but availability of land is limited and more or less fixed. Enormous population pressure on land is a contemporary phenomenon. So assessment of land suitability for different economic activity is a very imperative for natural resource management. The present study aims to determine suitability of land for agriculture, pasture, forestry and industry. GIS based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique is used for land suitability classification. Versatile thematic components, namely soil-depth, soil-texture, river-buffer, MNDWI (Modified Normalized Differentiate Water Index), NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index), Groundwater, rainfall, landuse and landcover, curvature, slope and elevation are integrated in a GIS environment. It was produced based on weighted overly by using AHP technique. Land suitability of drought prone Gandheswari Watershed is divided into seven land suitability Classes, namely, Class-I: Highly suitable for agriculture [84 km2], Class-II: Moderately suitable for agriculture [81 km2], Class-III: Low to Moderately suitable for agriculture [76 km2], Class-IV: Transitional zone-I, having less agriculture, agro-forestry and pasture [57 km2], Class-V: Suitable for Agro-forestry and pastureland [51 km2], Class-VI: Transitional zone-ii [26 km2], Class-VII: Suitable for industrialization (25 km2). The land suitability map of the study area has been validated by using present landuse and landcover ground truth point. Then, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is prepared for validation of the methodology used in this work. The result of Area Under the Curve (AUC) is good indicating an accuracy of (0.72) 72%. The result of this Potential land suitability for economic activity can be helpful in sustainable land use and land cover development, land conservation planning and strategy formulation for management of land.

<body color = blue>
   In eastern India, Durgapur is one of the fastest growing cities. The land cover and land use of Durgapur are shifting very hurriedly due to urbanization, which adversely impacts the local land resources there. This study was done from 1991 to 2021. To an attempt was made in this study to determine how the urban growth area grew over time. Aside from that, an attempt has been made to examine the pattern of urban expansion in Durgapur. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Built up Index, Built up Index were analyzed to evaluate the urban expansion of Durgapur city from 1991 to 2021. According to the findings, vegetative area is decreasing in the city central areas (13.9–6.32%) while built-up area percentages are increasing in the central areas (78.42–84.75%). In 1991, the mean value of the built-up index in the study region was 0.04, which was transformed to 0.1 in 2021. Within a thirty-year time span, the degree of modification in the Built up area is perfectly visible.

<font color = red>3.GEO-SPATIAL ASSESSMENT OF GROUNDWATER DROUGHT RISK ZONE DUE TO DROUGHT PROPAGATION IN THE UPPER DWARAKESHWAR RIVER BASIN (UDRB), WEST BENGAL:</font color = red>
<body color = blue>
   Groundwater drought (GWD) occurs when groundwater supplies decline and become unsuitable or unavailable for human use as a result of a prolonged meteorological drought. The physical and socio-economic problems associated with limited groundwater availability and access are exacerbated during a droughts. This chapter presents an integrated geographic information system (GIS)-based weighted overlay methodology for assessing Groundwater Drought Risk (GWDR) zones using four meteorological, six hydrological, and six socio-economic parameters. The following procedure is used to calculate GWDR: GWDR = (PGDH × SGDV). PGDH stand for Physical Groundwater Drought Hazard and SGDV for Socio-economic Groundwater Drought Vulnerability. Finally, GWDR -- zone maps is classified into five risk zone, namely very low, low, moderate, high, and very high, covering an area of 270 (13.96%), 437 (22.60%), 495 (25.59%), 477 (24.66%), and 255 (13.18%) km2 respectively. The rainfall anomaly index (RAI) and groundwater level statistic   al co-relationship was also used to validate the technique. The findings suggest that the approach used to determine GWDR in the region is successful, which will aid planners especially in groundwater engineering, hydro-geologist and government officials in developing groundwater management and drought mitigation plans.

<body color = blue>
   Lepchakha is a remote hill hamlet in the Alipurduar District of West Bengal which attracts the nature lovers from its vicinity. This hill hamlet faces many challenges as well as opportunities for development of ecotourism. However, the tourism obviously yields the economic stability of the Dukpa tribes providing their livelihoods. The present study deals with the potential strengths of ecotourism as well as scope of community participation in ecotourism through both qualitative & quantitative studies. Finally, the study reveals that a motorable road, good mobile network and financial help for initiation & renovation of homestay will promote the ecotourism using available natural beauties and cultural uniqueness of this study area.
